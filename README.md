This is a django project task for the outreachy internship application. In this task provided by wikimedia I am asked to create a django project with an app and also I am supposed to create views for my models. These are the foundations tasks. Requirements are python and django framework. I installed the required python version in my computer then I had to create a virtual environment for django installation. After this I created a django project using django-admin startproject command. I then changed into the directory of the project and ran the command python manage.py runserver to make sure my project is started well. Finally I created the django app named bug using python manage.py startapp command.
